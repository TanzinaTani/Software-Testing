A software named 'Virtual Educational Assistant' is taken for software testing. From the software, three UML sequence diagrams are designed and then those diagrams are tested and verified using two different tools. 
For the first testing, LTSA and FSP notations are used with the help of Itsatool tool. 
And for the second testing, Spin Model Checker based approach using PROMELA language is implemented.
